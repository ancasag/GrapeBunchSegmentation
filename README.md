# GrapeBunchSegmentation

In this repository, we provide the notebooks with which the results have been obtained. These are divided into four folders:
*   Basics: The notebooks of the experiments applying the basic experiments.
*   PseudoLabel: The second folder that has the notebooks with the tests done by applying the pseudolabel.
*   BestModel: The third folder contains the notebooks where the pseudolabel is applied using the model with the best results.
*   Ensemble: And finally we have the "basic" folder where are the notebooks that apply pseudolabel with the five models whose results were the best.
